## About me

I have a background in social sciences and began my programming journey with R. I started learning Python in late 2022 to enhance my data analysis skills at work, which sparked a growing interest in machine learning, object-oriented programming, and web development. Iâ€™ve since expanded my technical toolkit to include modern web technologies such as Svelte and SvelteKit (with TypeScript/JavaScript), FastAPI, .NET, and Azure.
