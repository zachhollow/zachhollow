## About me

I have a background in social sciences and began my programming journey with R. I began learning Python To improve my data analysis skills at work, which sparked a growing interest in machine learning, object-oriented programming, and web development. Iâ€™ve since expanded my technical toolkit to include modern web technologies such as Svelte and SvelteKit (with TypeScript/JavaScript), FastAPI, .NET, and Azure.

When I was in middle school, I stumbled on command prompt and quickly realized that it was a coding tool, albeit mysterious and cryptic. My middle school's computer lab did not have password-protected computers, and after a few Google searches on how to shut down computers using cmd.exe, I learned how to shut down my own desktop and any consenting friend's computer. It felt like magic, but I quickly ran out of simple spells and tricks and found myself engulfed by a myriad of coding documentation and resources. 

Overwhelmed, I put cmd.exe away, and throughout high school and college I found myself more interested in books, articles, and academic papers involving anthropology, history, foreign languages, political science, human rights, and international relations. I started learning R in college as part of a course on econometrics and data analysis for political science. A professor of mine raved about Python and Jupyter Lab as alternatives, but I mostly stuck with R for simple tasks such as data visualizations and regression due to familiarity and a discomfort with non-statistical programming languages or software.

I got my first job as a market research analyst in June 2022. In December 2022, a day before my workplace's annual winter holiday party, I decided to learn Python for data analytics/machine learning and JavaScript for web development. I felt limited with R, a renewed interest in Python, and re-emerging nostalgia from when I first stumbled upon command prompt. I bought an annual subscription to Codecademy in late December 2022, and effectively fell into "tutorial hell" during 2023. 

In early 2024, I sought a server-side framework beyong Node.js and Express.js, and I began learning ASP.NET Core with C#. I currently use .NET and C# for enterprise-grade back-end microservices, alongside Python for scripting, data analytics, and machine learning.
