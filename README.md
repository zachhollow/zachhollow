## About me
When I was in middle school, I stumbled on command prompt and quickly realized that it was a coding tool, albeit mysterious and cryptic. My middle school's computer lab did not have password-protected computers, and after a few Google searches on how to shut down computers using cmd.exe, I learned how to shut down my own desktop and any consenting friend's computer. It felt like magic, but I quickly ran out of simple spells and tricks and found myself engulfed by a myriad of coding documentation and resources. Overwhelmed, I put cmd.exe away, and throughout high school and college I found myself more interested in books, articles, and academic papers involving anthropology, history, foreign languages, political science, human rights, and international relations. I started learning R in college as part of a course on econometrics and data analysis for political science. A professor of mine raved about Python and Jupyter Lab as alternatives, but I mostly stuck with R for simple tasks such as data visualizations and regression due to familiarity and a discomfort with non-statistical programming languages or software.

I got my first job as a market research analyst in June 2022. In December 2022, a day before my workplace's annual winter holiday party, I decided to learn Python for data analytics/machine learning and JavaScript for web development. I felt limited with R, a renewed interest in Python, and re-emerging nostalgia from when I first stumbled upon command prompt. I bought an annual subscription to Codecademy in late December 2022 and effectively fell into "tutorial hell" during 2023. In 2024, I wanted a server-side framework outside of Node.js and Express.js and I began learning ASP.NET Core with C#. I became proficient with Razor pages and comfortable with C#, but through Microsoft .NET documentation and courses, I learned about architectural modularity and microservices. This prompted research in Go, due to its minimalism, strong concurrency, and strength as a microservice, and it is now my go-to server-side web development language (no pun intended), in addition to Python for scripting, data analytics, and machine learning.

Throughout my journey, I've embraced the evolution of my interests and skills, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. So far, I'm grateful for the many programming experiences that have honed my problem-solving abilities, allowing me to tackle complex issues with creativity, and the amazing tech friends that I've made along the way. As I look forward, I'm excited to continue exploring the ever-expanding world of tech.

### TL;DR
I have a background in social sciences and initially learned R. I started learning Python to improve my data skills at work, and my interest eventually evolved into object-oriented programming, web development, and machine learning. I currently use Svelte/SvelteKit, Go, and Azure.
