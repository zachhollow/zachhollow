## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I have a background in social sciences and began my programming journey with R. I started learning Python in late 2022 to improve my data analysis skills at work. Iâ€™ve since expanded my tech stack to include Svelte and SvelteKit (JavaScript/TypeScript), FastAPI, .NET, and Azure.
